## Getting Started

Check your development environment! You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) installed. The official Gatsby website also lists two articles regarding this topic:

- [Gatsby on Windows](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-on-windows/)
- [Check your development environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/)

### Adding a new page

Create a new `.tsx` file in the `src/pages` directory

### Adding new features/plugins

You can add other features by having a look at the official [plugins page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins/)

### Editing the site

```
npm run dev
```

### Building the site
